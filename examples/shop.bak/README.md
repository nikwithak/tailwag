# Tailwag Example: Retail Shop

I built this example to port some of the logic and data structures from an
earlier application I built. The goal was to build a practical, working example
of an application using the framework, and implement the missing features that I
feel are required for the full-featured framework I hope to achieve.

With this example, I built out nested data structures (One-to-One), image
uploads (multipart), and async queued tasks (worker pattern). I've also had to
rework and fine-tune some tech debt that I created when hacking together the
bare bones cases at the beginning. Ultimately I'm very happy with this
iteration, and I have a strong direction to take this app.
